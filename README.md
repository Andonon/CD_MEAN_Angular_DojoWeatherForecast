## Dojo Weather Forecast
Create an app which presents the user with 6 different views (using the router-outlet) each different url/view should present the user with a Dojo city. Within each of these views, present the user with the current weather information. This assignment will require you to retrieve an API key from https://openweathermap.org/api

Additionally, show an image of each of the cities, you can use https://www.pexels.com/ for royalty free images.

Use the following URL pattern for each city:

Default (root) url - 'http://localhost:4200/' should immediately redirect us to your local Dojo url. 

Seattle, WA - 'http://localhost:4200/seattle'

San Jose, CA - 'http://localhost:4200/sanjose'

Burbank, CA - 'http://localhost:4200/burbank'

Dallas, TX - 'http://localhost:4200/dallas'
